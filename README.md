# esp_python_car-racer

a python-esp8266 game where esp8266 is connected to gyro and python controlls a car

requires python 3, pygame, an esp8266, and a MPU-something accelerometer and gyroscope

esp to Mpu pin connections:
5 volts to vcc, 
gnd to gnd, 
d1 to scl, 
d2 to sda

python_code.py and car_crash_sound.ogg need to be in the same directory, same with all esp files

thanks to KebabLord for esp2python connection code
